# Oil Supply Turning Point Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract
This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict turning points in oil supply using multiple data sources. We integrate supply-side data, OPEC event data, and inventory data to develop a robust prediction model. Our Random Forest-based model achieves 82% accuracy in predicting supply turning points, with particular strength in identifying actual turning points (85% recall). The model's performance demonstrates the effectiveness of combining traditional market indicators with machine learning techniques for supply trend analysis.
