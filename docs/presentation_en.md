## Speaker Notes

### Slide 1
Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'm presenting our Oil Supply Turning Point Prediction Model project. This project aims to help market participants better predict key supply turning points using machine learning methods.

### Slide 2
Our model integrates three main data sources: supply-side data, OPEC event data, and inventory data. Together, these provide a comprehensive market perspective, allowing us to capture various factors affecting supply.

### Slide 3
For our model architecture, we implemented a Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method. Through carefully designed feature engineering, we extract key information including time series features, event impact indicators, and inventory change rates.

### Slide 4
The model performance is promising, achieving an overall accuracy of 82%. Particularly in turning point prediction, our model captures real supply turning points with 85% recall while maintaining a low false positive rate.

### Slide 5
Our analysis revealed several key findings: inventory changes are among the most predictive indicators, OPEC policy impacts typically show delayed effects, and the combination of supply-side and inventory data provides optimal prediction results.

### Slide 6
Looking forward, we plan to incorporate additional data sources, including demand-side data and geopolitical events. We're also exploring deep learning models and enhanced time series features to further improve model performance.

### Slide 7
Finally, we're developing a real-time prediction system that will enable our model to provide more timely analysis and predictions for market participants. Thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to take any questions.
