# Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Oil Market Turning Points: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract
This project implements a machine learning approach to predict turning points in the oil market by analyzing the complex interplay between supply-side factors, demand indicators, and market events. Using real-world data from multiple sources including EIA, OPEC reports, and market databases, we develop a Random Forest model that achieves 82% accuracy in predicting market turning points. The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques in energy market analysis and provides insights into the key factors driving market dynamics.
